Project Overview

The Bank Loan Application System is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts the probability of loan default and makes real-time loan approval decisions using a recall-optimized Decision Tree model.

The system follows real banking workflows, separating KYC data from risk-assessment features, applying business-defined credit policies, and deploying the final solution as a production-ready web application using Streamlit.
